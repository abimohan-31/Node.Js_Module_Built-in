//This module, containing both a client and server, can be imported via require('node:http') (CommonJS) or import * as http from 'node:http' (ES module).

//The Node.js HTTP API is very low-level. It deals with stream handling and message parsing only. It parses a message into headers and body but it does not parse the actual headers or the body.
